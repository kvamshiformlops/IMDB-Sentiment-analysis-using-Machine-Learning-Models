### Models Implemented

Certainly! Here's the updated list with brackets around each item:

Sure, here's a brief overview of each model:

1. **[Logistic Regression]**: A statistical model that predicts binary outcomes (yes/no) based on one or more predictor variables.
2. **[Support Vector Machine (SVM)]**: A supervised learning model that classifies data by finding the best hyperplane that separates all data points into categories.
3. **[Decision Tree]**: A model that uses a tree-like structure of decisions and their possible consequences, which splits the data into branches to make predictions.
4. **[Nu-SVC]**: A version of Support Vector Classifier that allows for the control of the number of support vectors and the margin errors.
5. **[Random Forest]**: An ensemble learning method that creates multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.
6. **[Naive Bayes]**: A simple probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.
7. **[Gradient Boosting]**: An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, each correcting the errors of its predecessor to improve accuracy.
8. **[SGD Classifier]**: A classifier that uses stochastic gradient descent for optimizing the loss function, suitable for large-scale and sparse data.
9. **[Linear SVC]**: A linear Support Vector Machine used for classification tasks that works by finding the hyperplane that best separates the data.
10. **[Neural Network (MLP)]**: A multi-layer perceptron that simulates the way the human brain processes information to recognize patterns and make decisions.
11. **[LightGBM]**: A gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms, designed for speed and efficiency.
12. **[Extra Trees]**: An ensemble learning method that creates a forest of randomized trees and averages their predictions for improved accuracy and control of overfitting.
13. **[AdaBoost]**: An ensemble method that combines multiple weak classifiers to form a strong classifier, by focusing on the errors of the previous classifiers.
14. **[Histogram Gradient Boosting]**: An optimized version of gradient boosting that uses histograms to speed up the training process.
15. **[K-Nearest Neighbors]**: A non-parametric method that classifies data points based on the majority class among the nearest neighbors.
16. **[XGBoost]**: An advanced implementation of gradient boosting that focuses on speed and performance, often used in competitive machine learning.
17. **[CatBoost]**: A gradient boosting library designed specifically for categorical features, aiming for high performance and efficiency.
